# Discord Formatting
There are many ways to add color into your discord messages.

## **Bold**, *italic* and __underscore__
Discord uses markdown to highlight messages, so you have a lot of things to play around with!
`**Bold**`, `*italic*`, `__underscore__`, and `` `code ticks` ``. You can also have block codes:
````
```
like this!
```
````
You can read more about this [here](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51).

## Escaping
You may have noticed it's not possible to actually type a literal \`\`\` in discord. You can use backslashes (` \ `) to do this!
```
\``` escaped! \```
\*\*not bold!\*\*
```

Now you can tell your friends all about markdown!

## Languages
Code blocks can also highlight languages. This can be 'exploited' to get color!
````
```css
.blue text
```

```diff
- red
+ green
```

```yaml
yellow
```
````

You can see more colors [here](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51).

## Custom ansi escapes!
This one took me a while to get working, try copying this text:
````
```ansi
[1;33;4;45mWow!
```
````

There's a lot of things you can do, but this is still in the beta, so its not on all devices (namely mobile) at the time of this writing. You can learn more about it [here](https://gist.github.com/kkrypt0nn/a02506f3712ff2d1c8ca7c9e0aed7c06). You can copy the special character [here](http://www.unicode-symbol.com/u/001B.html).

# Closing
That's some cool things I've found on discord. Hopefully you learned something new, and you can be on your way to becoming a discord poweruser!
