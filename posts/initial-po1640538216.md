# Initial Post
Hello, I made this blog website in hopes to document thought processes for any future projects I make, and hopefully give more insights to what I'm making. Hopefully you the reader find this helpful and useful.

## This website
This website is run on next.js, and uses showdown and gray-matter to parse all the blog post. Writing in HTML is hard. In the future, I plan to actually host this and have its own dedicated domain, maybe connected to some portfolio website? You'll have to stay tuned to find out about that!

## Closing
This is just my first blog post, more coming soon!
